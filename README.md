# Project Name

The project is a collaborative whiteboard application that allows multiple users to draw on a shared canvas in real-time. It provides various drawing tools, synchronization across devices, and the ability to export drawings as images. The project also includes a user-friendly interface and a live demo for testing purposes. However, there may be a temporary delay in synchronizing changes due to the backend server being hosted on a free server.
